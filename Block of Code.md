<h1>Example of a Code Block</h1>
  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/4199zzjb7KS._AC_.jpg" alt="Happy Face">
  <p The image I chose to include in this code block is a happy face. I think it is very simple and a good option when you aren't sure what picture would be the bes
to include in a project. In my opinion, it was a safe option. </p>
  <p> if you take a look in the "<> Edit file" tab, you will see a block of code!</p>
